# boost

boost is a collection of optimizing interpreters for engine262. Contrary to the
goals of engine262, boost provides fast execution time at the cost of
understandability and modifiability.

boost targets:

- JS function [[Call]] and [[Construct]] behavior.
- JS top-level Script and Module evaluation.
- RegExp execution
